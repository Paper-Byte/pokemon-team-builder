# pokemon-team-builder

Pokemon Team Builder is a simple web-based application for creating a Pokemon team of 6 members with any Pokemon from Generation I to Generation V.

## Usage

To create a team, a user can scroll through the complete list of 649 Pokemon and select their Pokemon or they can filter by type with the icons located on the left hand side of the screen. When selecting one of these icons the list is narrowed to only Pokemon with a primary or secondary typing that matches. When a Pokemon is selected the card will be updated allowing the user to view the base stats of said chosen Pokemon. Once the user has selected 6 Pokemon, they are able to save that team. If using a json server (link to the json server [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)), they will be able to save their team and the save will persist on refresh. The user is also able to update the 'Trainer Name' by submitting their chosen name via the 'Trainer Name' form at the bottom of the screen.
